# My Personal Portfolio

The code used for my portfolio located: http://jurvis.co/work/

## Setting Up
Run this on htdocs with MAMP as you'll be needing it to view TypeKit Fonts

That's basically it.

## Current Projects on Display
* [Multitude](https://github.com/multitudeapp)
* Nebulo
* [Carousell](http://carousell.co/)
* RelayPlay

## Support and Tested
* ~~iPhone 5/5S~~
* ~~iPad Mini~~
* ~~15" Retina Macbook Pro~~
 

Everything works everywhere now. (Except < IE9)
