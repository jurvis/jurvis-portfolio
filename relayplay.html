				<h3>"Personal Stories"</h3>
				<p>
					RelayPlay takes up the challenge of coming up with a mobile app that will digitally engage audiences during major sporting events to participate - bringing the games closer to the regional communities during events such as the Women's Tennis Association Championships in 2014 and 28th SEA Games in 2015.
				</p>
				<p>
					The solution tries to involve people to crowd-write a story. By allowing everyone to contribute two words to a story, each user will then 'bump' on the next device to 'pass the torch' - making the torch relay fun interactive, and personal. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Using the Bump API, we built this solution on iOS and Android for interoperability and had a web backend to help keep track of individual stories being recorded and kept track of the locations where these 'bumps' happened - to be able to visually see how far the "torch" has travelled.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyone who has participated in the passing of the "torch" will then always be able to look back at the story he/she has helped contribute to and how far it has grown - this will help encourage virality and people to start and contribute to other stories. Making the experience both personal, engaging and fun during these sporting events.
				</p>
				<p>
					TL;DR: This app encourages users to "relay" 2 words between device to device to help crowd-write a fun story for the games.
