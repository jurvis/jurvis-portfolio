				<h3>Meaningful Data</h3>
				<p>
					Feedback are often too dispersed on Twitter - it's too difficult to have any discrete data to work with, especially when everyone adopts a different prose in their tweets/posts.
				</p>
				<p>
					By setting a discrete set of parameters, we can work easily with this set of data and solve the seriously fragmented world of customer feedback. In this context, we're trying to gather data of commuter experiences on trains.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using Bluetooth Low Energy and Apple's iBeacon API, the team made use of the iPhone's Bluetooth hardware to communicate with the Bluetooth 4.0 dongle on the Raspberry Pi to detect whenever a commuter leaves a station. When detected, the commuter will receive a notification asking him how was his commute with pre-defined parameters; Great or Bad?
				</p>
				<p>
					If the user's feedback is "Bad", the product will then prompt the user to further elaborate his feedback - which makes sense, since someone will usually have something to say if they had a negative experience. However, if a user's feedback is "Great", we will not further annoy them and ask them to elaborate on a good experience, because most of the time there isn't much to say about positive experiences.
				</p>
				<p>
					TL;DR: This app conveniently solved the problem of gathering user feedback by providing the user convenience with a seamless, unobstructive experience.
